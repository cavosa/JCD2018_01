  <h1>The Issue in Sydney</h1>
  <h2>Global warming is causing sea levels to rise & threatening Sydney's coastline</h2>
  <h3>Locations under threat of being inundated include:</h3>
  <p> 1) Byron Bay, and 2) Sydney's Northern Beaches and 3) Botany Bay, Sydney Airport <p>
  <br>
  <p>Climate experts have said rising sea levels can displace more than 200 thousand people</p>

  <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <h2>Callaroy Beach, June 2016</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Surging storms in Sydney's Northern Beaches caused significant erosion along the coastline.
      <li> Waves up to 8 meters high hit the coast, causing damage to neighbourhood backards.
      <li> What could this possibly mean to Sydney's population alongthe coast with this current rate of Global warming?
      <li> It is important to act now, to preserve our beaches and future inundation of Sydney.
    </ul>

    <h1>The Solution Proposal</h1>
    <h2>The threefold design solution to combat inundation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The rising sea levels are fast becoming an overwhelming force for Sydney’s coastal. 
Our design confronts this issue through a practical yet still distinctive approach in order to better the future for life on Sydney’s magnificent coastline. 
Our proposal is threefold: the initial solution of a dam wall provides the foundation to integrate the ancillary road and terraced farm idea to nurture the reenvisioning of a coastal lifestyle.
      <li> The design along Collaroy Beach was formed to explore the theme of a ‘universal’ space for Collaroy’s multiple uses. 
The structure has been proposed to replicate a vital organism expressing its internal forces through the various elements working together 
with the nature of materials used to generate authentic forms mirroring Collaroy’s residential, commercial and transport requirements.

    <h1>Mapping the Sea Wall</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> Situated along one of Sydney’s finest beaches, will be a 4.5km long structure that confronts three significant concerns associated with coastal Sydney: 
rising sea levels; bottleneck peak hour traffic and lacklustre design aesthetics.
      <li> One of our ancillary issues was the transport bottleneck along Spit Road that has, for decades, plagued northern beaches residents with countless, wasted precious time. 
By raising the transport network above ground level to avoid the peak hour traffic, the bridge element of our design creates a sensation more suited to the coastal lifestyle.
